-- Description:
-- This script contains all major SQL steps used to analyze customer behavior
-- within the Instacart dataset â€” specifically focusing on how different time
-- segments affect reorder speed and order size.
--
-- Steps Included:
-- - Step 5a: Temporal Analysis Prep
-- - Step 5b: Repurchase Cycle by Time Segment
-- - Step 5c: Order Size by Time Segment
-- - Step 6: Repurchase Momentum Index (RMI)
-- - Step 7: Supporting Behavioral Metrics

-- Step 5a: Temporal Analysis Prep
-- Goal: Prepare core metrics to analyze how time-related dimensions affect purchasing behavior

-- Logic:
-- 1. Extract hour of day, day of week, and weekday/weekend flag from orders table
-- 2. Count number of products per order to calculate order size across all orders
-- 3. Join both tables to produce one row per order with time and behavior metrics
-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Extract time-based fields from the orders table
WITH time_dimensions AS (
	SELECT
		order_id,
		order_hour_of_day,
		order_dow,
		CASE
			WHEN order_dow BETWEEN 0 AND 4 THEN 'Weekday'
			ELSE 'Weekend'
		END AS weekday_or_weekend,
		days_since_prior_order AS repurchase_cycle
	FROM orders
	WHERE eval_set = 'prior'	-- filter to 'prior' orders only to ensure full user purchase history is complete ('train' and 'test' involve incomplete data)
),

-- Count number of products in each order (i.e., order size)
order_sizes AS (
	SELECT
		order_id,
		COUNT(*) AS order_size
	FROM order_products__prior
	GROUP BY order_id
)

-- Join time and behavior metrics at order-level
-- Save result as a temporary table for future reuse
SELECT
	td.order_id,
	order_hour_of_day,
	order_dow,
	weekday_or_weekend,
	repurchase_cycle,
	order_size
INTO TEMP time_order_metrics
FROM time_dimensions td
LEFT JOIN order_sizes os ON td.order_id = os.order_id;

-- Display results

-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 5b: Repurchase Cycle by Time Segment
-- Goal: Analyze how time-based factors influence the reorder speed of customers

-- Logic:
-- 1. Use `time_order_metrics` (from Step 5a)
-- 2. Group by hour of day, day of week, and weekday/weekend to calculate average repurchase cycle for each time segment
-- 3. Also include total number of orders for each time segment to provide more context
-- 4. Filter out first-time orders where repurchase_cycle is NULL
